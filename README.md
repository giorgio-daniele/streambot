# streambot
A simple tool for automating Layer-2 and Layer-7 tracing on content provider websites (currently, Amazon Prime and DAZN are supported). It allows you to loop over a list of URL channels offered by the Content Provider, recording packet-level and HTTP-level data through Wireshark and HAR traces.

## Features
- Automates tracing for Content Providers like Amazon Prime and DAZN
- Loops over a list of channel URLs and records traces
- Captures both packet-level and application-level (HTTP) data

## Instructions

1. **Set up credentials and cookies:**
   - For each Content Provider folder, there are two files:
     - `scraping.js`: Automates the tracing process
     - `register.js`: Handles the sign-in process
     
   - Before running `scraping.js`, run `register.js`** to save your credentials and cookies for subsequent logins. This will generate a folder called `user_data`.

2. **Run scraping.js:**
   - Once youâ€™ve completed the sign-in process, you can run `scraping.js` to start the tracing of the channels.



## Configuration
You can configure the bot via the `config.yaml` file. The following parameters are available:

### 1. repetitions
- **Description**: Number of times to repeat the channel URLs list.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  repetitions: 3
  ```

### 2. load
- **Description**: Time in seconds between actions (e.g., clicking).
- Example:
  ```yaml
  load: 2
  ```

### 3. play
- **Description**: Time in seconds to watch a URL in the channel list.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  play: 10
  ```

### 4. homepage
- **Description**: The URL where the Content Provider lists all channels.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  homepage: "https://www.example.com"
  ```

### 5. channels
- **Description**: List of channels to watch. Each channel includes the URL and its name.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  channels:
    - name: "Channel 1"
      url: "https://www.example.com/channel1"
    - name: "Channel 2"
      url: "https://www.example.com/channel2"
  ```

### 6. sniffer
- **Description**: Settings for the sniffer, including the path toward the executable file, the network interface toward Internet and the maximum size of the packet capture. Ensure a regular user can sniff without being a superuser.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  sniffer:
    bin: "/usr/bin/tshark"
    net: "enp1s0"
    max: 500
  ```

### 7. login
- **Description**: Settings for signing in (email and password).
- Example:
